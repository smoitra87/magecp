\subsect{Alpine Ascent of Seneca Rocks January 2013}
\textbf{Team:} Felix Duvallet \& Tyler Quinn \\
Trip report by Tyler Quinn


Over the weekend of January 11th, the Explorer's Club of Pittsburgh's Mountaineering School took a trip to West Virginia to make an alpine style ascent of Seneca Rocks. Our plan was to wake up at 1am, start the 12 mile hike by 2am carrying our climbing and bivy gear, arrive at Seneca in the morning, climb as much as possible in packs and mountaineering boots, bivouac on the rocks, rappel down on Sunday morning, and get back to Pittsburgh before dark. It was a nice little Saturday.

\begin{Figure}

\end{Figure}

By 1:45am, we started hiking northward. Around 4am we started fighting fatigue and the waiting for the sun to come up. At 6:45am we turned off our headlamps and harnessed our second wind for the last push. After the last bit of elevation, we hit the pipeline at 7:30am, our turn off the trail. On the pipeline, we were pleasantly greeted by grazing horses from the ranch we were travelling through. Around 8:30am we arrived at the Seneca trail head to refill our water in the stream before our climb.


It was an unusually warm January morning, perfect climbing weather. We decided to avoid the “stairmaster” by starting our climb on the Skyline Traverse (5.3) at the base of the East Face. This climb was a great way to get comfortable climbing in mountaineering boots and full packs. From there, we made our way to the base of Le Gourmet (5.4). We followed the first pitch of this route and then climbed Front C (5.6). The moves proved to be a challenge in boots, forcing Felix to use an impressively high heel hook in mountaineering boots on lead. After these pitches, we made our way to Old Man's Traverse Ledge to prepare for our last pitch of climbing. We decided to end the day with the Critter Crack (5.6). After a couple impressive moves, Felix topped out on this lead with the abbreviated alpine rack just about gone. Soon after, I summited the climb after a couple falls. We high fived, and made our way to the summit for a picture.

\begin{Figure}

\end{Figure}

After the summit, we rappelled half way down the East Face to the Alcoa Ledge. With the afternoon climbers still on the rocks, we had to wait to set up our bivy. I took advantage of this time to take a power nap, hanging in my harness off of the bolts. By 5pm we were cooking dinner of couscous, chocolates, and tea. Using some creativity, we fit both of our bivy sacs on the four foot wide ledge as the sun set.   We soon settled into our sleeping bags, hoping we didn't roll over in our sleep!

\end{Figure}


By 7am the next morning, we were up and brewing tea before our morning rappel. We touched down safely and were hiking out by 8:30am. Soon we were back at the campground, thankful to rest our tired legs and take our heavy packs off. It was a long, hard weekend that taught me a lot about alpine climbing. As a first timer on this trip, I learned that it isn't always pretty or easy, but, in the end will you know why everyone comes back every year.

\subsect{Ode to the freshette - Michelle Najera}
	
\textit{
When I climb and play outdoors you bet \\
That on hand I'll have me my freshette \\
With my trusty friend I'll never wet... \\
My pants \\
Or need wander yonder into the woods \\
Scanning for a sly spot to squat
\\
\\
Nay, I stand proud with back turned \\
With a sweet comfort I've quickly learned \\
can come from a wee pink bit of plastic 
\\
\\
Each season new ladies sing your praises \\
In gear-laden packs, your presence graces \\
You are my bud \\
I am your stud \\
And together we will trod many paces }

The rock school committee, Jim Schuring (chair) Brian Ottinger, Brian Cowan, Brian Kent, Leslie Brown, and Erica Karapandi convened along with the returning co-directors Paul Guarino and Matt (buttercup) Janick. As a summary of the meeting the major points of interest are; we have decided to take a no tolerance policy on the no dogs, spouses, significant others to attend the classes or outings by students or instructors. Rush has agreed to allow us the use of his building in Mckees Rocks for the indoor classroom sessions. The application has been rewritten to allow the applicants to express themselves. The 5th outing which in past has been optional in the past is now mandatory. John Zolko has opened his house up for the student/instructor intro- party, part of which time we will use for a brief instructors meeting. The monthly ECP meeting on March 14th will be the last day to turn in applications as well as give the prospective students a chance to meet the co-directors. Early February is the target date for information on the web site.

Minutes of the General Meeting - January 10, 2013 7:30 p.m.\\
Union Project, 801 N. Negley Ave., Pittsburgh, PA
\\
\\
Meeting opened 7:45pm – 11 members (quorum plus 1) and 1 applicant in attendance
                                            5 more members arrived later

\textbf{OFFICER REPORTS:}
\\
\\
President, Rush Howe: - Reported – we are here.\\
Vice-President, Bill Baxter – Reported – Tonight's program will be a Power Point Show by Phil Sidel\\
Secretary, Phil Sidel – Reported – Read December BOG minutes (bold type sections of minutes published in January Newsletter.)  Explained that vote to approve meant approval of the actions of the BOG.  Minutes were approved as read.\\
Phil also reported that he will be assembling a committee to work on updating the Policies and Procedures statements.  He hopes to include someone (probably Tom Prigg) who worked on the original Mike Brown Expeditions Fund procedures so they can be included.  He asked that any volunteers to help with that see him at the break.  (No one volunteered at the break.)
\\
\\
No other officers were in attendance to report.
\\
\\
\textbf{APPOINTEE REPORTS:}
\\
\\
It was noted that Librarian Phil Breidenbach cannot attend meetings, but would like to continue managing the library.  We are hoping to find someone who could pick up sets of books and other items to bring to the meetings and collect and return deposits, while Phil houses and reports on the Library.
So far we haven't had anyone volunteer for that; we are planning to ask members who live near Phil to volunteer for that.
\\
\\
Historian, Phil Sidel, reported that some items have been added, but not yet inventoried.  Nick Ross has  a historic record of an Ice-Flow trip, but plans to treat it with a preservative before submitting it to the archive.
\\
\\
Other appointees not present.
[Note, the Membership Coordinator was not present, and the meeting neglected to move for approval of the new applications.]

\textbf{COMMITTEE REPORTS:} 
\\
\\
Jim Schuring reported that he has accepted chairmanship of the Rock School Committee. Volunteers to serve on that committee should contact him.  He is hoping to include two graduates from the 2012 Rock School.
\\
\\
No other Committees Reported.
\\
\\
Valerie Kramer, Chairperson of the Audit Committee has been out of town; is expected to return in a few days.
\\
\\
\textbf{TRIP REPORT:}\\
John Zolko and Brian Cowan reported on an ice-climbing/back-country-skiing trip that turned out to be very difficult and unsuccessful, largely because of inadequate equipment and difficult weather conditions.  Despite the difficulties and loss or failure of some of the equipment, there were no injuries; all returned safely.
\\
\\
\textbf{OLD BUSINESS:}\\
Review and approval of the 2013 proposed budget had been omitted at the December General Meeting.   Until a new budget is approved the club operates on the 2012 budget.  April is the final month for approving or revising the budget for the current year.  It was moved and seconded to approve the proposed budget as printed in the December Newsletter.  It was noted that in that proposed budget the allocation for “organizational memberships and donations to other organizations” had been increased to \$1000.  Some of us missed the line item allocations for sponsorship of the Reel Rock Tour and the Seneca Summit, but they were there in the proposed budget.\\
\\
The 2013 budget as proposed in the December Newsletter was approved.
\\
\\
\textbf{NEW BUSINESS:}\\
Ginette Vinski has drafted and emailed to members a Response on Management Plan (as proposed by NPS) for Shenandoah National Park.   Phil Sidel suggested that the Response, as drafted by Ginette, should be sent on to the NPS over Ginette's signature as the ECP Environmental Coordinator.  Sam Taggart expressed some questions and reservations about the Management Plan which he would like to see answered before sending in our formal response, but given the time requirements, he approved of the letter as drafted.   Motion to send the letter/Response to NPS was passed.  [1/12/2013 – Ginette reports she has sent in the Response Letter.]
\\
\\
Use of Social Media [MeetUp and/or other programs] to reach out and notify interested people of ECP activities and opportunities.   There was discussion of the advantages and costs of these media.  It was suggested that if there are costs for using MeetUp or another medium, we might partly recover them by charging people participation fees, refundable as partt of their ECP membership fee..It was felt that there should, perhaps, be a committee to investigate and present a report or proposal on using one or another of these media.  Perhaps that should come under the Advertising Chairperson (Tara Powers) but she seldom attends meetings.  No specific action was taken.
\\
\\
\textbf{MEETING ADJOURNED – 8:40pm} 
\\
\\
Mike Ciccone won \$16 in the 50-50 Raffle;  
\\
\\
\textbf{PROGRAM:}  Phil Sidel presented a Power Point slide show on his 1999 trip to Arizona for his 50th High School Reunion and climbing with Greg “Steelmonkey” Opland.

\textbf{Attendees:} \\
Bill Baxter, Ron Edwards, Phil Sidel, Subhodeep Moitra, Kathleen Prigg, Mike Ciccone
\\
\\
\textbf{OFFICERS REPORTS:} \\
Bill Baxter, VP, report:
   Greg Buzulencia will present a program; probably at the February Meeting
Phil Sidel, secretary, report:
   Phil still needs volunteers for updating policies and procedures. He is thinking of asking Tom Prigg, 
   Maggie Schneider, Derek Stuart, and Brian Ottinger. It is, of course, open to any club members willing and
     desirous to have a hand in it. 
   BOG Members, permanent appointees and directors of schools will not be asked to be on this committee.
   Some of the tasks  -  (to be divided up among committee members)
	Review published policies statement to see what issues are left unresolved
	Look at old BOG minutes to see what policies might change.
	Draft revisions in separate topic areas.
Ron Edwards, Activities chair, report:
Recycling plant tour, 6 members, 9 people tour. Ron might contribute to newsletter or present in Feb meeting. If we make it more popular, there might be more next time at the event.
Ski night :  Not sure if there might be snow. Designed for families. $20/family. Club members will get clinic for beginners.
January has a few (4) good events. February is looking sparse, Ron will try to line up more.
Kathleen Dreher, Treasurer, presented the December ____ fund balances:
	Bogel Fund		$  9,420.89
	Mike Brown Fund	$  1,833.00
	Equipment Fund	$  2,691.86
	General Fund		$  7,887.05
	   Total Balance	$21,832.80
   (Line item breakdowns of 2012 Budget and Revenues and Expenditures to date are shown in separate table)

Kathleen further reported:
   Budget for Mt. Washington Cleanup needs to be revisited since according to accounts it did not cost anything.
Kathleen must find out what must be reported to maintain (or improve) our tax status. Maggie Schneider might be able to provide guidance or information on this process.
Equipment chair (Not present)


APPOINTEE REPORTS:
Webmaster: (Not present)
   Tom George has expressed willingness, but he is not sure about Drupal
Historian :
   Nothing to add
Membership Coordinator: (NotPresent)
   Michelle was disappointed that New Applicants were not voted on at January General Meeting.
   She has issued them membership cards anyway.
   She is no longer updating the website data base,.  
      This may mean that membership website privileges are no longer properly allocated.
      (have they been up to now?)
      What should be members-only privileges on website? (access to members info, activity entries, editing?)
  She is maintaining membership on a spreadsheet.

GENERAL BUSINESS – REVIEW OF JANUARY TASKS
Valerie Kramer, chair person of the Audit Committee, should be available now. Treasurer can contact her to find out plans for audit.
    There was discussion of the importance of proper handling of funds, including dues payments, raffle collections, school fees, event fees, and others.  Some kind of receipt should be given, and the funds should be placed in an envelope or other special holder and marked as to source, purpose.  Finally, the funds must be deposited to the club's bank account by the treasurer or other authorized signatory and the treasurer notified  as to source and purpose of the monies, so they can be correctly recorded and allocated to the proper accounts.
Treasurer, Kathleen Prigg, will check back on some of these possible items, since her records show less revenues from some sources, such as raffles, than we understand were collected in 2012.
Activities Chair, Ron Edwards, has appointed a number of new Activities Coordinators, but there are still a few openings.
President Rush Howe re-appointed all the standing appointees.  There was discussion of whether Tara was continuing as Advertising Chairperson, since we have not seen her nor received reports from her for some time.
GENERAL BUSINESS – REVIEW OF FEBRUARY TASKS
Bill Baxter, VP needs to assemble roast committee
Michelle, Membership Coordinator:
   Unpaid members need to be dropped
	Procedures for this must be worked out with Webmaster or Website Committee
   A Membership Directory must be distributed to the members.  That will probably have to be done
   using the Spreadsheet, since the Members section of the new website is currently inadequate.
   

OLD BUSINESS:
MeetUp groups :
Mike Ciccone reported:
   He had researched the costs and other aspects of setting up a MeetUp Group.
   The costs varied depending on the length of time you contracted for, available promos, and other factors
   For example a 6 month commitment would be ~$12 per month.
   Events would be announced to members (individual membership would be free)..  Others could search and find our calendar for events that might interest them.
   It was noted that if having the group brought in one member per month, it would pay for itself.
   (at the General Meeting, it had been noted that if we charged a small fee --say a dollar applicable toward a membership fee -- to participants who didn't join some of the costs would be recovered.)
Alternatives were considered.
  Posting events on other MeetUp Groups (Perhaps making a small donation to the MeetUp Group's owner)
  Using the various free communications and networking sources we already have 
     (our website, our yahoo groups, facebook, possibly Google Groups)
After reviewing these costs and options, the BOG decided it was not worth paying to set up an ECP MeetUp Group.
This discussion led to a discussion of our current Yahoo Groups.
1. Would we do better switching to Google Groups?  Ron reported that he had investigated this and found Google Groups is not mature enough. At this point Yahoo Groups are more manageable.  
2. ECP-BOG Yahoo Group was apparently set up to include current BOG Members only.It was perhaps intended as a Yahoo Group to which anyone could post, but only BOG members would receive the messages.  However it does not allow outside members to post.  (Ron subsequently checked and found that Secetary Phil Sidel had set it up and was the 'owner.'   It is not used and will be deleted)

NEW BUSINESS:
1. Ron Edwards :  Found many old and useless files in the files section of BOG Group Site.
He is committed to cleaning it.. 
2. Defunct BOG mailing list that needs to be deleted.
3. We will Post Agenda to BOG files
4. Since Constitution and Policy Statements do not specify a frequency for BOG meetings, the BOG decided to skip having a February 2013 BOG meeting – at least as a trial.. 
5. Next BOG meeting 21 March at Phil and Irene Sidel's house.

\\
\\
{\Large OFFICER REPORTS:}
\\
\\
\textbf{President, Rush Howe}- Reported that he will serve as President for another Year.  \textbf{He officially reappoints all the permanent appointees for year 2013.}
\\
\\
{\bf Vice President, Bill Baxter - Has no presentations/slide-shows for up-coming meetings}.  It was suggested that he contact Dave Martin for a presentation on \emph{"Frost Bite"}.
DVD's in Library can also be used.
\\
\\
{\bf Secretary, Phil Sidel} - Notes that as Secretary he is responsible for maintaining record of policies - {\bf There is need for an updated published statement of Policies and Procedures.  Phil will work on this and assemble a committee to assist him.}  Because a major item to be updated is the policies and procedures regarding the Mike Brown
Fund, it is important {\bf to include someone from the original committee that set the Mike Brown fund up} (Tom Prigg, Toni Price, Ron Edwards, ...)
\\
\\
\textbf{Separate mailing lists will be used to send attachments} (such as draft minutes for review) \textbf{to BOG members who get "Daily Digests."} of BOG Group messages.
It was also noted that a separate email-address list for just the current officers or current officers and appointees would be helpful.
\\
\\
\textbf{Activities Chair, Ron Edwards - We have 4 events listed for January, all ECP events:}
\begin{itemize}
\item   New Year's Day Hike
\item   Greenstar Recycling Plant Tour - Jan 9 on Neville Island
\item   Annual Roast Weekend Jan 19-20 - at a Ski Area
\item   Wednesday (Jan 23) Evening Ski Session at Boyce (pending snow).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The list of Activity Coordinators remains unchanged.}
We encourage them (and others) to come up with ECP activities - It is a goal to have at least one Beginners Activity each month (in January we have 2).

Other officers not present - no reports
\\
\\
{\Large APPOINTEE REPORTS}
\\
\\
{\bf Membership Coordinator, Michelle not present}
--New applications no longer need BOG review and approval\\
\textbf{--ECP stickers are selling very well}. Maybe we should have ordered a batch of 500 instead of 200.\\
\textbf{--Ron will submit an article for publication on the new "Life Member Cards"}
--Because of unresolved problems with Membership section on the new website, \textbf{Michelle is setting up membership list on spreadsheet.}
\\
\\
\textbf{Historian, Phil Sidel}
\textbf{--Archive should include a list of 2012 members.}  Names only is sufficient.  He might add info on offices and appointments held.
\\
\\
\textbf{Advertising, Tara Powers} (not present)
--It was noted that she should be contacted to determine what is being done.
--Phil noted that as editor he did not follow up on Judith's plan of having a \textbf{page on organizations that offered special rates or offerings for ECP members}, but he thinks it \textbf{is a good idea}.  (In retrspect he thinks he should have published this page since \textbf{it was formally approved by the BOG)}.
\\
\\
\textbf{Librarian, Phil Breidenbach} (not present)
\textbf{--Phil wants to continue, but cannot attend evening meetings.  We would like to have someone take on responsibility to pick up a selection of items from Phil and bring them to meetings - handle to lending and collection and return of deposits at the meetings.
}It was suggested that we send out special requests to people living in Phil's neighborhood to do this.
The idea of having some items stored at The Union Project (as we did at Frick Environmental Center) was discussed.  Ron volunteered to send communication to Phil B to indicate options for an assistant (courier) and the possibility of subset storage at our general meeting location."
.
\\
\\
{\Large COMMITTEE REPORTS:}
\\
\\
--\textbf{Rock School Committee Report is past due.}  Bill Baxter will contact Jeff to get it in - he understands it is drafted and just needs editing.
\\
\\
--\textbf{Backpacking School Committee Report is due.}  Jamie Billings and Chris Ciesa were co-directors.
\\
\\
{\Large OLD BUSINESS:}
\\
\\
--\textbf{ Kathy Dreher is working on plans for Roast} - may appoint committee and get volunteers to handle related tasks
\\
\\
-- Establishment of Committee to Update Policies And Procedures Document (see Secretary's Report above)
\\
\\
-- \textbf{Valerie Kramer will Chair the Audit Committee.  She will assemble committee of at least 3 - Officers are ineligible - and set date for the audit.} [Secretary's note: I will contact Valerie to find out where things stand regarding appointments for members of the committee and setting a date for the audit]
\\
\\
-- The December General Meeting did not review/approve the 2013 proposed budget.  This can be done at the January General Meeting.
\\
\\
{\Large NEW BUSINESS / December TASKS}
\\
\\
-- \textbf{Ron Edwards will notify Tom George to update the officers list on the website.}  New officers are Subhodeep Moitra as Editor and Philip Sidel as Secretary.
\\
\\
-- \textbf{Website administration - We think Tom George would be willing to take over as webmaster/administrator,} but he doesn't know the system (Drupal).
In fact, it is uncertain if any one person sufficiently knows the new system to effectively manage it; some parts seem to be not working at this point - perhaps because updates have not been installed.  Tina previously mentioned she was working on an Administrator's Guide, but it is not yet done.
\\
\\
-- Next BOG Meeting.\textbf{ Bill will host the January BOG Meeting third Thursday in January (January 17th)} \\
\\
It was noted that the Constitution states: "The Vice President shall set the dates, place and frequency of such meetings and publish them in THE EXPLORER." So t\textbf{here is no requirement for holding a BOG meeting every month.  At the January meeting the BOG will decide whether to meet in February.  Phil and Irene volunteered to host the first BOG meeting after the January Meeting.}
\\
\\
-- It was suggested that Club meetings (and events?) be announced in MeetUp.  This led to \textbf{a lengthy discussion of club communications through various internet networking media} - Invitation only Groups (such as Yahoo \& Google Groups), and various kinds of open groups such as MeetUp, Facebook, et cetera. Advantages and disadvantages of various media and types were cited. There was no clear sense of the meeting about using any of these, but it was noted that the open groups are opened and there is no way to stop nor control them.

Meeting Adjourned 9:30pm


\subsect{Mountaineering School report}

\begin{Figure}

 \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{pics/mtschool2013.jpg}
\end{Figure}


At the midway point in this year's Mountaineering School, we have 15 strong students, with one withdrawal due to illness. The biggest change from previous years was the location of the first two outings which were much closer to home than in previous years. Mountaineering 101 was held at Harrison Hills Park and the Land Navigation class was held in Hartwood Acres.We are looking forward to the Seneca and ice Climbing outings later this month. With such a large class, the Seneca summit ledge could be quite crowded on Saturday evening.
 
The School Christmas party included a knot-tying competition which was nearly won by Jessica Goelz. Unfortunately, she fumbled the final knot which gave Chris Ciesa time to uphold the instructors' pride.
 
Thanks to all of the instructors who have provided lectures, support on the outings and all of the other assistance that is essential to the School.

Recycle your Christmas tree!
\\
\\
Many municipalities in the area are offering options for recycling your Christmas tree (live ones; not artificial). Some municipalities compost trees into mulch for use in local parks.  Other municipalities sink the trees into rivers to serve as natural habitats for fish and wildlife.
\\
\\
Below is an overview of Christmas tree recycling information for Allegheny County.  For options in Butler, Beaver and Westmoreland Counties, see the news article below: "Discarded Christmas trees keep on giving all year."  For other western PA counties, call their public works departments.  It is unclear if the City of Pittsburgh is recycling Christmas trees this year.  Residents may try calling the recycling division at (412) 255-2773 or the 311 hotline.
\\
\\
Allegheny County \\
- Runs through Saturday, January 19, 2013 \\
- County residents may drop off trees daily from dawn to dusk.  \\
- All lights, decorations, tinsel and stands must be removed from the trees.  \\
Trees may be taken to these locations: \\
South Park - Parking lot at the swimming pool
North Park - Parking lot at the swimming pool
Settlers Cabin Park - Parking lot by the wave pool
Hartwood Acres Park - Parking lot at the mansion
Deer Lakes Park - Parking lot by the Veterans Shelter
Harrison Hills Park - Parking lot at the intersection of Chipmunk and Cottontail drives
Boyce Park - Parking lot by the wave pool
Round Hill Park - Parking lot between Meadow and Alfalfa shelters
White Oak Park - Parking lot by Poplar Shelter
\\
\\
Here's an article from the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review about how different counties are recycling their Christmas trees:
Discarded Christmas trees keep on giving all year
"...Allegheny County mulches Christmas trees and uses them in its parks; Butler and Fayette counties leave them whole and anchor them in area lakes and streams to improve fish habitats. ... Westmoreland County uses mulch from Christmas trees to line walking trails in Hempfield Park, and in Beaver County, mulch from about 100 chipped Christmas trees is sold to residents in the spring.  ... The Army Corps of Engineers places whole trees in the Youghiogheny River Lake to be used as fish habitat, said Park Ranger Ronald Slezak. Officials at Moraine State Park do the same.”

New changes to how to dispose of electronic equipment!
Beginning January 24, 2013, electronic equipment including computers, printers, monitors, audio equipment, iPads and Kindles can no longer be thrown away with regular garbage.  The Covered Device Recycling Act (CDRA, House Bill 708), Act 108 of 2010, requires manufacturers to provide recycling programs for these types of items.  
\\
\\
For more information on the new law, or a more comprehensive list of recyclers, visit the state's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) website at dep.state.pa.us, or call their toll-free hotline at 1-800-346-4242.  Here is a direct link to more information:
\url{http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/electronics_recycling_management_program/20342}

Review in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\\
In this breathtakingly beautiful film, acclaimed National Geographic photographer James Balog uses time-lapse cameras to capture a multi-year record of the world's changing glaciers. His gorgeous yet haunting images compress years into seconds and capture ancient mountains of ice in motion as they disappear at a heartbreaking rate. Traveling with a team of young adventurers across the Arctic, Balog - who was once a skeptic about climate change - risks his career and his well-being in pursuit of the biggest story facing humanity today. As the debate polarizes the country, and the intensity of natural disasters ramps up, Chasing Ice depicts a heroic photojournalist on a mission to deliver fragile hope to this carbon-powered planet.

\paragraph{What does an Activity Coordinator do?}
General advocacy and point of contact for the activity by helping current, new, or prospective members
get connected with others in the club also interested in the activity and any events planned for it.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Seek out new members at general meetings (during the break or at the after-meeting) that
indicate the activity as one of their interests and introduce yourself as that activities
"coordinator” that can help them connect with and explore the activity.
\item Answer incoming emails to the club (sometimes redirected from officers or others who receive
the inquiry) related to the activity. This is rare.
\item Spread the word if you see any local events or news related to the activity that you think
members would like to know by posting (or reposting) on the Listserv and mentioning at any
General Meeting that you attend. In some cases, create an Event (takes 2 minutes) on the ECP
calendar to give that event extra visibility.
\item Encourage any members that are planning an event on their own or as a small/closed group to
consider opening it up to the general membership in the form of an official Event (and have
them create the Event)
\item If possible, directly or indirectly ensure that at least one Event for your activity occurs every year.
\end{enumerate}

\fbox{\parbox{\linewidth}{
