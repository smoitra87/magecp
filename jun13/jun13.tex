\subsect{Black Forest Trail - Shane Shin}
The Black Forest Trail is a 42.5 mile hiking loop in the Tiadaghton State Forest. The trail had been on my radar and I was waiting for the perfect opportunity to hike it.  According to the Keystone Trails Association the BFT “may be the most challenging and rewarding backpacking resource in Pennsylvania”. I found a remote quality to the area where the only sounds were wildlife and the many waterfalls. The guidebook is called “The Black Forest Trail – A Backpacker’s Interpretive Guide” by Chuck Dillon. In it the author states “the BFT is not a novice trail – there are demanding ascents and descents, challenging stream crossings… and rocky, rough sections that will test the quality of your hiking boots.

\begin{Figure}

 \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{pics/P1030973.jpg}

\end{Figure}

I left Pittsburgh in a steady light rain and encountered similar wet weather on most of the 3 1/2 hour drive up to Slate Run. Luckily it was not raining when I pulled into the trailhead, and stayed dry for the rest of the day. As chance had it I was starting at about the same time as someone else, an enigmatic former Appalachian Trail thru-hiker who called himself Arrowhead.

\begin{Figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{pics/P1030977.jpg}
 \captionof{figure}{Rock School 2013 outing at Coopers Rock}
\end{Figure}

The first stream crossing was about 1 mile into the hike, and it was a big one. I got there just in time to see Arrowhead wading through. I walked up and down the stream and decided there was only one way across. With my boots off and my hiking poles ready I started wading across the slippery rocks. Soon I was in up to my chest and I almost lost my balance and got swept down.  I decided to back out, and I found a different crossing which was only as deep as my waist. Once on the other side I chatted with Arrowhead about the trail. He broke out the pipe and herb and I decided to hike on. The trail climbed 1500 feet up a rocky ridge passing many viewpoints. At some point Arrowhead caught up to me and we hiked together for awhile and I got many funny thru-hiking stories. I set up my tarp after about 10 miles at a clearing near a small stream.

\begin{Figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{pics/P1030991.jpg}
 \captionof{figure}{Rock School 2013 outing at Coopers Rock}
\end{Figure}

The second day had me following a stream down into a ravine for many miles.  The only problem was that the trail kept switching which side of the stream it wanted to be on.  There was maybe 20+ stream crossings, each of which involved some serious rock hopping.  I was glad when the trail turned uphill.  Later on I hiked through some wetland alpine areas which were very similar to Dolly Sods.  The wildflowers were all out giving the green and black forest little spots of color. I ended up camping near a nice waterfall that evening and getting into my bag while there was still a little light out.

\begin{Figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{pics/P1030986.jpg}
 \captionof{figure}{Rock School 2013 outing at Coopers Rock}
\end{Figure}

On day 3 I hiked out under a dense canopy of Hemlock trees that blocked out the sunlight, giving the trail its name.  The temperature had dropped overnight and I experienced some flurries and hail. The trail ended up followed a valley out and there were many cascading waterfalls. At this point the forest was all huge pine trees and the floor was well carpeted with soft needles.

\begin{Figure}

\end{Figure}

I love backpacking because out on the trail, there is not much else besides the trail. I stopped each day when I didn’t feel like hiking anymore, and didn’t wake up to an alarm. The BFT is a beautiful trail which is the equal of any in Allegheny or Monongahela National Forest. The BFT is crisscrossed by a number of side trails and roads making it possible to do a loop hike of almost any length. Campsites and water are everywhere along the trail. There are more views than I could count. I am definitely coming back, maybe in October?

\paragraph{What does an Activity Coordinator do?}
General advocacy and point of contact for the activity by helping current, new, or prospective members
get connected with others in the club also interested in the activity and any events planned for it.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Seek out new members at general meetings (during the break or at the after-meeting) that
indicate the activity as one of their interests and introduce yourself as that activities
"coordinator" that can help them connect with and explore the activity.
\item Answer incoming emails to the club (sometimes redirected from officers or others who receive
the inquiry) related to the activity. This is rare.
\item Spread the word if you see any local events or news related to the activity that you think
members would like to know by posting (or reposting) on the Listserv and mentioning at any
General Meeting that you attend. In some cases, create an Event (takes 2 minutes) on the ECP
calendar to give that event extra visibility.
\item Encourage any members that are planning an event on their own or as a small/closed group to
consider opening it up to the general membership in the form of an official Event (and have
them create the Event)
\item If possible, directly or indirectly ensure that at least one Event for your activity occurs every year.
\end{enumerate}

\fbox{\parbox{\linewidth}{
{\Large\bf ECPers!!}\\
Contact the Coordinator for activities in which you want to participate.\\
There are many activities which are not listed in the calendar,
because the arrangements are spur-of-the-moment, or because\\
they are regular, periodic (e.g., weekly) activities.\\
\\
Some examples are:\\
Weekly In-Line Skating Sessions\\
(Contact Coordinator Robin Kamin)\\
Yoga Sessions in Frick Park\\
(Contact Yoga Coordinator Elise Nolan)\\
Flat Water Canoeing trips\\
(Contact Coordinator Nick Ross)\\
