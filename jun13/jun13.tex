\sect{Trip Reports}


\subsect{Black Forest Trail - Shane Shin}
The Black Forest Trail is a 42.5 mile hiking loop in the Tiadaghton State Forest. The trail had been on my radar and I was waiting for the perfect opportunity to hike it.  According to the Keystone Trails Association the BFT "may be the most challenging and rewarding backpacking resource in Pennsylvania". I found a remote quality to the area where the only sounds were wildlife and the many waterfalls. The guidebook is called "The Black Forest Trail - A Backpacker's Interpretive Guide" by Chuck Dillon. In it the author states "the BFT is not a novice trail - there are demanding ascents and descents, challenging stream crossingsâ€¦ and rocky, rough sections that will test the quality of your hiking boots.

\begin{Figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{pics/P1030973.jpg}
 \captionof{figure}{Trailhead Black Forest Trail}
\end{Figure}

I left Pittsburgh in a steady light rain and encountered similar wet weather on most of the 3 1/2 hour drive up to Slate Run. Luckily it was not raining when I pulled into the trailhead, and stayed dry for the rest of the day. As chance had it I was starting at about the same time as someone else, an enigmatic former Appalachian Trail thru-hiker who called himself Arrowhead.

\begin{Figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{pics/P1030977.jpg}
 \captionof{figure}{Arrowhead making a sketchy stream crossing}
\end{Figure}

The first stream crossing was about 1 mile into the hike, and it was a big one. I got there just in time to see Arrowhead wading through. I walked up and down the stream and decided there was only one way across. With my boots off and my hiking poles ready I started wading across the slippery rocks. Soon I was in up to my chest and I almost lost my balance and got swept down.  I decided to back out, and I found a different crossing which was only as deep as my waist. Once on the other side I chatted with Arrowhead about the trail. He broke out the pipe and herb and I decided to hike on. The trail climbed 1500 feet up a rocky ridge passing many viewpoints. At some point Arrowhead caught up to me and we hiked together for awhile and I got many funny thru-hiking stories. I set up my tarp after about 10 miles at a clearing near a small stream.

\begin{Figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{pics/P1030991.jpg}
 \captionof{figure}{Tarp Tent}
\end{Figure}

The second day had me following a stream down into a ravine for many miles.  The only problem was that the trail kept switching which side of the stream it wanted to be on.  There was maybe 20+ stream crossings, each of which involved some serious rock hopping.  I was glad when the trail turned uphill.  Later on I hiked through some wetland alpine areas which were very similar to Dolly Sods.  The wildflowers were all out giving the green and black forest little spots of color. I ended up camping near a nice waterfall that evening and getting into my bag while there was still a little light out.

\begin{Figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{pics/P1030986.jpg}
 \captionof{figure}{Wildflowers in bloom}
\end{Figure}

On day 3 I hiked out under a dense canopy of Hemlock trees that blocked out the sunlight, giving the trail its name.  The temperature had dropped overnight and I experienced some flurries and hail. The trail ended up followed a valley out and there were many cascading waterfalls. At this point the forest was all huge pine trees and the floor was well carpeted with soft needles.

\begin{Figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{pics/P1030988.jpg}
 \captionof{figure}{Camping spot near a nice waterfall}
\end{Figure}

I love backpacking because out on the trail, there is not much else besides the trail. I stopped each day when I didn't feel like hiking anymore, and didn't wake up to an alarm. The BFT is a beautiful trail which is the equal of any in Allegheny or Monongahela National Forest. The BFT is crisscrossed by a number of side trails and roads making it possible to do a loop hike of almost any length. Campsites and water are everywhere along the trail. There are more views than I could count. I am definitely coming back, maybe in October?\\

Tom showed some of the items he had collected from John Timo and others, including two trip reports in booklet form.  Phil noted that he had not seen any booklet trip reports like that in the archives.
BOG also discussed potential of engaging an archivist to perform a bulk scanning of all paper archives, including a box Tom has from the early years of the club, including impressively detailed and bound trip reports.\\
Next action:  Tom and/or Ron to seek potential services.

\textit{Adjourned 9:40p.m.:}

\subsect{Audit Committee Report:}

\textbf{Audit meeting/participants:}  On March 11, 2013, the audit was conducted of 2012.  Kathy Prigg, who took over the position of Treasurer mid-year in 2012 and is also the 2013 Treasurer presented the records as both the outgoing and incoming Treasurer.  Valerie Kramer, Paul Toth and Martha Gray comprised the Audit Committee.
\\
\\
\textbf{Audit Summary:}  The ECP records are kept in an Excel spreadsheet which is working well as a mechanism to track expenses and allocate revenues.  It also provides a simple way to compare budget to actuals. The Committee reviewed the detailed transactions for three months, selected randomly, confirmed bank balances were reconciled and reviewed the process of allocating monies to the various ECP funds (General, Bogel, etc.).  Everything was found to be in order and Kathy is going a great job of tracking things and making the necessary detailed entries.  The following is a summary of items discussed:

\begin{itemize}
\item The ability to pay dues via PayPal is working well.  The Treasurer is able to pull funds and reconcile them.  There are some additional small amounts due to how PayPal assesses fees and the Treasurer has been including them in the General Fund which the Committee concurs is correct.

\item Due to the limited number of budget lines, the Treasurer has been making notes attached to specific Excel cells if a given dollar amounts represents multiple items - this is a great practice and very helpful.

\item The Treasurer suggested that it would be a good idea to have cash receipt forms and to be able to give receipts when people give her cash - such as for memberships or for the 50/50 raffle.  The committee agreed this was a good idea and a good practice.

\item Previously, although the Mike Brown Memorial Fund had been authorized by the club, the financial spreadsheet and budget was not recording the revenue allocated to the Fund.  The Treasurer added this into the ECP financial records and has been accurately accounting for the Mike Brown Memorial Fund throughout 2012.  

\item The Treasurer is working on establishing a different money market account with a better return than the current PNC account; the committee supports this effort.
For record-keeping purposed, all receipts turned in should be marked as to who is submitting them and what is the purpose - can be handwritten on the receipt such as, "Bill Explorer for BOG meeting food - 3/4/2013.  The Treasurer can add a note as to the check number and date paid.


\item Contributions to various organizations were approved by BOG and membership during 2012 and should be made.


\item There are currently lines in the ECP General Fund Revenue and Expenses for the various schools.  We recommend those be eliminated as there is no budget allocation.  Any revenues and expenses should be recorded in the lines for the schools set up under the Equipment Fund.  The duplicate sets of lines for the same items cause confusion.  The Treasurer will eliminate these for 2013 based on the Committee's recommendation.  This will have no impact on the budget or the allocation or accounting for the schools.

\item Current practice is that school leaders are given the school tuition (other than that allocated to funds such as Bogel or Mike Brown) in advance for school related expenses.  Since the school tuition checks are written to the ECP, they are deposited by the Treasurer and then a check is written to the school leader for funds available for school expenses.  Gear deposits are left in the ECP accounts until the school refunds them - the refund process is up to the school directors.  The Audit Committee recommends at the end of each school, the school instructors should submit an accounting of what was spent as support for the initial allocation of funds.  Our understanding is that this is typically part of the final school report as well.  Any unused funds would be returned to the club.  Ron Edwards used a spreadsheet that we would recommend all school instructors use for this purpose.   


\item The overall accounting seems more complex than is necessary.   We suggested that there is an opportunity to simplify things if someone was interested in addressing this but it is not within the scope of the Treasurer's job (unless desired).  Some suggestions might be to have less line items (not track family and individual memberships), automate the splitting of dues and listing all schools in one place only.

\item While this is not in the scope of the audit, there was some discussion about membership with input from Martha in her role as the new Membership Chair and feedback she received from the current Membership Chair.  This committee would support efforts to remind current members who do not renew that a renewal is due. As an example, members of the 2012/13 Mountaineering School may not realize that though they joined in the fall, a renewal is due by December for the coming year.   Also, the ECP may want to consider letting new members join and pay online with their approval being done at the following meeting.  It is rare for a member to be rejected and it appears potential members are lost when they can't join online.  It is a barrier to require a paper application. Other items that came up is that PayPal may offer an automatic renewal and PopMoney may be a better or an additional way to collect funds.
\\
\\
In general, we want to thank Kathy for her diligence and her overall efforts - both in picking up the Treasurer job mid-year and continuing through 2013.  We also want to thank her for sitting through a long meeting while some of us acquainted or re-acquainted ourselves with ECP practices!

\paragraph{What does an Activity Coordinator do?}
General advocacy and point of contact for the activity by helping current, new, or prospective members
get connected with others in the club also interested in the activity and any events planned for it.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Seek out new members at general meetings (during the break or at the after-meeting) that
indicate the activity as one of their interests and introduce yourself as that activities
"coordinator" that can help them connect with and explore the activity.
\item Answer incoming emails to the club (sometimes redirected from officers or others who receive
the inquiry) related to the activity. This is rare.
\item Spread the word if you see any local events or news related to the activity that you think
members would like to know by posting (or reposting) on the Listserv and mentioning at any
General Meeting that you attend. In some cases, create an Event (takes 2 minutes) on the ECP
calendar to give that event extra visibility.
\item Encourage any members that are planning an event on their own or as a small/closed group to
consider opening it up to the general membership in the form of an official Event (and have
them create the Event)
\item If possible, directly or indirectly ensure that at least one Event for your activity occurs every year.
\end{enumerate}
