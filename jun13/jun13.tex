\subsect{Black Forest Trail - Shane Shin}
The Black Forest Trail is a 42.5 mile hiking loop in the Tiadaghton State Forest. The trail had been on my radar and I was waiting for the perfect opportunity to hike it.  According to the Keystone Trails Association the BFT “may be the most challenging and rewarding backpacking resource in Pennsylvania”. I found a remote quality to the area where the only sounds were wildlife and the many waterfalls. The guidebook is called “The Black Forest Trail – A Backpacker’s Interpretive Guide” by Chuck Dillon. In it the author states “the BFT is not a novice trail – there are demanding ascents and descents, challenging stream crossings… and rocky, rough sections that will test the quality of your hiking boots.

\begin{Figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{pics/P1030973.jpg}
 \captionof{figure}{Rock School 2013 outing at Coopers Rock}
\end{Figure}

I left Pittsburgh in a steady light rain and encountered similar wet weather on most of the 3 1/2 hour drive up to Slate Run. Luckily it was not raining when I pulled into the trailhead, and stayed dry for the rest of the day. As chance had it I was starting at about the same time as someone else, an enigmatic former Appalachian Trail thru-hiker who called himself Arrowhead.

\begin{Figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{pics/P1030977.jpg}
 \captionof{figure}{Rock School 2013 outing at Coopers Rock}
\end{Figure}

The first stream crossing was about 1 mile into the hike, and it was a big one. I got there just in time to see Arrowhead wading through. I walked up and down the stream and decided there was only one way across. With my boots off and my hiking poles ready I started wading across the slippery rocks. Soon I was in up to my chest and I almost lost my balance and got swept down.  I decided to back out, and I found a different crossing which was only as deep as my waist. Once on the other side I chatted with Arrowhead about the trail. He broke out the pipe and herb and I decided to hike on. The trail climbed 1500 feet up a rocky ridge passing many viewpoints. At some point Arrowhead caught up to me and we hiked together for awhile and I got many funny thru-hiking stories. I set up my tarp after about 10 miles at a clearing near a small stream.

\begin{Figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{pics/P1030991.jpg}
 \captionof{figure}{Rock School 2013 outing at Coopers Rock}
\end{Figure}

The second day had me following a stream down into a ravine for many miles.  The only problem was that the trail kept switching which side of the stream it wanted to be on.  There was maybe 20+ stream crossings, each of which involved some serious rock hopping.  I was glad when the trail turned uphill.  Later on I hiked through some wetland alpine areas which were very similar to Dolly Sods.  The wildflowers were all out giving the green and black forest little spots of color. I ended up camping near a nice waterfall that evening and getting into my bag while there was still a little light out.

\begin{Figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{pics/P1030986.jpg}
 \captionof{figure}{Rock School 2013 outing at Coopers Rock}
\end{Figure}

On day 3 I hiked out under a dense canopy of Hemlock trees that blocked out the sunlight, giving the trail its name.  The temperature had dropped overnight and I experienced some flurries and hail. The trail ended up followed a valley out and there were many cascading waterfalls. At this point the forest was all huge pine trees and the floor was well carpeted with soft needles.

\begin{Figure}

 \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{pics/P1030988.jpg}
 \captionof{figure}{Rock School 2013 outing at Coopers Rock}
\end{Figure}

I love backpacking because out on the trail, there is not much else besides the trail. I stopped each day when I didn’t feel like hiking anymore, and didn’t wake up to an alarm. The BFT is a beautiful trail which is the equal of any in Allegheny or Monongahela National Forest. The BFT is crisscrossed by a number of side trails and roads making it possible to do a loop hike of almost any length. Campsites and water are everywhere along the trail. There are more views than I could count. I am definitely coming back, maybe in October?

As well as the mountaineering styles and attitudes of  the Iranians, who live with spectacular high ranges a short trip from their capitol.

\subsect{Flag and Life Member Qualifications}
The Explorers Club of Pittsburgh has two levels of special honors to award to members who have contributed to the club and its objectives - Flag Membership and Life Membership (the highest honor. The description of these awards, as laid out in our Constitution is shown below, with the "qualifications" shown in bold type.  It will be noted that the qualifications are stated in broad, general terms, indicating that there are a variety of ways in which members can qualify.
\\
\\
We publish these "qualifications" at this time so that you, the members, will start thinking of nominees for Flag Membership and Life Membership and preparing to recommend/nominate candidates.  You will note that we can award only two new Flag Memberships per year - The most recent Flag Members are Ron Edwards (awarded in November 2012) and Bill Baxter (awarded in October 2012).  That means that we can award a Flag Membership in October and another in November this year.  If you are thinking of a worthy candidate for Life or Flag Membership - someone who meets the qualifications stated in the constitution, work up a nomination statement to present to the BOG, indicating the nominee's  qualifications for the honor. The initial nomination delivered to the BOG can (and really should) be made several months before the award will be voted on by the General Membership.
\\
\\
FROM THE ECP CONSITITUTON:\\
    \textit{ 3: Types of Membership: \\}
        c. Life membership may be granted to Flag Members who have been active club members for a minimum of ten years and who have contributed to the club and its objectives in such a manner as to warrant the highest honor the club can bestow. Any member can present to the Board of Governors candidates for Life Membership. The nomination shall include a written description of the candidate's qualifications and worthiness for this highest honor. If approved, the nominee is presented to the club membership at the next general meeting for the ratification by a majority of the active members present. The qualifications of a new Life Member shall be published in the EXPLORER.\\
        d. To warrant the second highest honor the club can bestow, the person under consideration for Flag Membership must have made significant contributions towards achieving the club's goals of research, education, and adventure. Flag membership is a lifetime honor and may be extended to members who have been active for a minimum of five years, approved by the BOG and ratified by a majority of the active members present at the next club meeting. There shall be no more than two voting Flag Members at any time. Flag members shall retain a vote on the BOG for twelve months following their ratification by the membership. Each Flag Member shall receive a flag, bearing his or her number, at the club's expense. Any member can present to the BOG candidates for Flag Membership. The nomination shall include a written description of the candidate's qualifications and worthiness for this high honor. If ratified, the candidates qualifications shall be published in the EXPLORER.

There are so many things to do in the outdoors, there are so many things we as enthusiasts can participate in, so many sports that will get us outside!    To cover them all would be impossible, so this month, let's talk about just one of them, hiking, one of my favorite activities.
	From the simple walk across town, from your home to your business or school, to an extended hike through the extreme wilds near the bottom of a mountain peak, hikes come in all sizes.  Most of us tend to fall into the group that takes the occasional couple mile long hike with a nice long one squeezed into a vacation or weekend.   I know there are a lot of club members who regularly take the much longer hikes, often into land that is unmarked, relying on their maps and compasses. (A skill we should all know!)
	The club library has numerous books on trails you can explore, from  the simple bike trails here around the city, to those on the sides of Mt. McKinley.  With our extensive collection of guide books, chances are we have something that is near where you want to go!
	 Here are just a few of the books we have that cover hiking and related activities, in no particular order;

\subsect{Staying Engaged with the ECP}
\textit{A multi-part series on tips and techniques for staying "in tune" with the club.}\\
\\
\textbf{ECP Listserve - What is it and how do I subscribe?}\\
\textit{The ECP Listserve is also often referred to as the "Yahoo Group" or "e-mail list".  A "subscription" simply means that you have added your name to the distribution list and therefore will receive e-mails sent to the Listserve.
}
\\
\\
\textbf{What is it?}\\
The ECP Listserve is nothing more than an e-mail distribution list for all members that subscribe to it.  In other words, it is one e-mail address that automatically forwards e-mail to the entire list of e-mail addresses that have subscribed.  When you subscribe, you cause two things to happen:
\begin{enumerate}
\item    You now have the ability to send e-mail to the Listserve.  You do this by sending any e-mail message you want everyone to receive to \url{explorers_club_pittsburgh@yahoogroups.com.}
\item     You now will receive any e-mail that is sent to the Listserve e-mail address (\url{explorers_club_pittsburgh@yahoogroups.com}) by other members.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Wait, but I am already subscribed to an ECP Listserve, are there multiple listserves?}\\
Yes, there are multiple Listserves run by the club. There is one main Listserve for ECP members (\url{Explorers_Club_Pittsburgh@yahoogroups.com}) and then other Listserves for the various schools that the ECP conducts. If you become a student in one of the schools you will be asked to join that particular Listserve as a means for communicating about activities related directly to those Activities. You may want to also be subscribed to the main Listserve so you don't miss out on anything.
\\
\\
\textbf{Who should subscribe?} \\
If you want to be absolutely sure to not miss any last-minute activities, events, or changes to them, you should subscribe to the Listserve.  If you want to be privy to some of the casual club member conversations, subscribe to the Listserve.  If you often can't attend the general meetings, and don't read your Explorer newsletter religiously, subscribe to the Listserve.
\\
\\
\textbf{Who shouldn't subscribe?}\\
If you do not have an e-mail account, you can't subscribe.\\
If you don't check your e-mail very often (less than once every couple of weeks), you probably won't benefit from the Listserve.\\
If you really don't want to stay informed on club events and activities, you don't need to subscribe.
\\
\\
\textbf{How do I subscribe?}\\
Simply send a blank e-mail (from the e-mail account where you want to receive ECP Listserve e-mail) to \url{explorers_club_pittsburgh-subscribe@yahoogroups.com}.  (Be sure to get the underscores and dash exactly right.)  That's it!  Your subscription will be reviewed by our List Manager (a human being) to make sure you're a club member and real person (not spam).  You'll be added to the Listserve in a matter of a day or two in most cases.
\\
\\
\textbf{What if I have problems subscribing?}\\
Email Martha Gray, Membership Coordinator, at \url{graymf@gmail.com} and she will assist you.

 \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{pics/bike.jpg}
\end{Figure}

Inflate those tires, oil those chains, and gear up for the 2013 National Bike Challenge, sponsored locally by Bike Pittsburgh and OTB Bicycle Cafe! Officially kicking off on May 1 and ending September 30, this free and friendly competition encourages Pittsburghers to get out and ride, whether as daily commuters, weekend warriors, or somewhere in between. The challenge helps riders realize the health, economic and environmental benefits of riding a bike. Riders can choose to participate as individuals or teams, and see how they stack up against others in the Pittsburgh region, and across the nation. This year we're working to register 1,250 Pittsburghers to help our region pedal to the top spot in the country!
\\

\paragraph{What does an Activity Coordinator do?}
General advocacy and point of contact for the activity by helping current, new, or prospective members
get connected with others in the club also interested in the activity and any events planned for it.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Seek out new members at general meetings (during the break or at the after-meeting) that
indicate the activity as one of their interests and introduce yourself as that activities
"coordinator" that can help them connect with and explore the activity.
\item Answer incoming emails to the club (sometimes redirected from officers or others who receive
the inquiry) related to the activity. This is rare.
\item Spread the word if you see any local events or news related to the activity that you think
members would like to know by posting (or reposting) on the Listserv and mentioning at any
General Meeting that you attend. In some cases, create an Event (takes 2 minutes) on the ECP
calendar to give that event extra visibility.
\item Encourage any members that are planning an event on their own or as a small/closed group to
consider opening it up to the general membership in the form of an official Event (and have
them create the Event)
\item If possible, directly or indirectly ensure that at least one Event for your activity occurs every year.
\end{enumerate}
